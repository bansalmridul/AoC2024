My solutions to Advent of Code 2024. I think they're pretty good, though I haven't looked at other people's code to confirm as such. 
If you want to run it, just make sure the python file and its associated input are in the same folder and follow the same naming scheme as here. 
If you want to run it on the smaller problem, put the input into the "inputXX-t.txt" and pass True to whichever day+part you want to run.

I doubt anyone will read this, but if you have any questions just ask.
